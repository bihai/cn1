#Steve's CodenameOne Fork

This github repository is my personal fork of the fantastic [Codename One](http://www.codenameone.com) mobile application framework.  I periodically merge changes from the Codename One SVN repository, but this fork also includes a few custom tweaks to help support offline builds.
